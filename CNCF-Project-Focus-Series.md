# CNCF Project Focus Series

> Educational deep-dives into CNCF projects through hands-on learning and real-world application in Financial Services environments.

## 📚 About This Series

The CNCF Project Focus is a learning series where I explore Cloud Native Computing Foundation projects by building production-ready examples, documenting lessons learned, and sharing practical insights from implementing these technologies in FinTech contexts.

**Focus Areas:**
- Hands-on GitHub repositories with deployable examples
- Real-world use cases in Financial Services
- Governance and FinOps patterns
- Integration with existing toolchains (Kyverno, ArgoCD, etc.)

**Format:**
- LinkedIn carousel for quick overview
- GitHub repository with complete examples
- Medium article for deep technical dive

## Learning Philosophy

**Building beats consuming**
Each episode includes complete, deployable code rather than theoretical explanations. All examples are tested and production-ready.

**Context over hype**  
Honest comparisons with existing tools (Terraform, Istio, etc.) and clear guidance on when to use each technology based on real-world context.

**FinTech focus**  
Examples and patterns tailored for Financial Services requirements: compliance, governance, cost control, and regulatory considerations.

**Learning in Public**  
Documenting the learning journey authentically, including challenges, mistakes, and discoveries.
